# AWS Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to the **AWS Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects, solutions, and experiments I've conducted using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Each project aims to solve real-world problems or demonstrate best practices for cloud architecture.

---

## Overview

This repository showcases various AWS projects covering a wide range of use cases, including:

- **Cloud Architecture Design** â€“ Building scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud-native solutions.  
- **Automation and Scripting** â€“ Using AWS CLI, SDKs, and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, AWS SAM) for automation.  
- **High Availability & Disaster Recovery** â€“ Implementing multi-region deployments, backups, and failover strategies.  
- **Security Best Practices** â€“ Leveraging IAM, encryption, WAF, and security monitoring tools.  
- **Serverless Applications** â€“ Developing event-driven architectures with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.  
- **Data Analytics & Storage Solutions** â€“ Using S3, Redshift, and Aurora for data storage, processing, and retrieval.  
- **Machine Learning & AI** â€“ Deploying AI-driven solutions with Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker, and AI-powered chatbots.  
- **Compute & Containerization** â€“ Running scalable workloads on Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, and EKS for container orchestration.  
- **Microservices & Kubernetes** â€“ Designing distributed architectures with Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), and service meshes.
- **FlutterFlow & SupaBase** - Building an e-commerce platform in FlutterFlow, leveraging Supabase for Auth, Database, and Storage with role-based access and using Dart for                                custom backend actions.

Each project is documented with detailed steps, architecture diagrams, and code examples to help you understand the implementation.

| **Hybrid Software Distribution Solution** | Designed a hybrid cloud architecture for a global software distribution platform, migrating from an on-premises system to a cloud-native, containerized solution. This architecture ensures scalability, availability, and efficient software deployment across a geographically distributed user base. [View the Project Architecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GfHhAhYLoRq0gFjgkeHHe8XyDJVrDpwf/view?usp=sharing)| AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, AWS Systems Manager (SSM), Amazon API Gateway, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS IAM, CloudFront |
| **Agentic LLM Assistant** | Designed and implemented an AI-powered chatbot using Amazon Bedrock, enabling real-time conversations with serverless architecture. The system leverages Cognito for user authentication, Lambda for compute logic, DynamoDB for conversation history, and Aurora PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search. This architecture ensures scalability, security, and efficient data management while providing users with an interactive AI assistant.[View the Project Architecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tdsESgr905eoJGOCpVNTvskkJI7t-qNL/view?usp=sharing) | AWS Lambda, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Cognito, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, Amazon Aurora (PostgreSQL & pgvector), AWS IAM, AWS Systems Manager (SSM), Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Amplify |
| **FlutterFlow MarketPlace Project** | Architected and developed an e-commerce application using FlutterFlow with Supabase backend. The solution supports two user roles â€” Customers and Suppliers â€” using Supabase Auth with RLS for secure access control. Customers can browse and purchase products, while Suppliers can add and manage inventory. Data is managed via Supabase Database (Users, Products, Orders tables) and Supabase Storage handles product images. Designed the full system diagram, implemented custom queries, role-based conditional UI, and set up Trello for clear project timelines and DevOps tasks.[View the Project Architecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19U3oQad-13moByA_SQiINaEHIxfv6PTV/view?usp=sharing) | FlutterFlow, Supabase Auth, Supabase Database, Supabase Storage, Role-Based Access Control (RLS), Trello, Dart code.|
