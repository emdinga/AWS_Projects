## Overview

This repository showcases various AWS projects covering a wide range of use cases, including:

- Cloud architecture design
- Automation and scripting with AWS CLI and SDKs
- High availability and disaster recovery solutions
- Security best practices
- Serverless applications
- Data analytics and storage solutions

Each project is documented with detailed steps, architecture diagrams, and code examples to help you understand the implementation.
